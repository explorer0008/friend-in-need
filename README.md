This is pure front end project made from HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. I used different parts of bootstrap like Modals and Cards and used few APIs like HTML5 Geolocation API, ReliefWeb API, Stripe API.
This webpage connects people and whosoever is willing to help the needy in the nearby area can offer their help directly.
